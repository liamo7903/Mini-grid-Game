# Mini-grid-Game
As part of my 3rd year project, I was tasked to create an engineering demonstration for a high school audience, with the intention of encouraging them to pursue an engineering career. Other requirements of the demonstration demanded a link to a Sustainable Development Goal, inclusion of an MSP430fr4133 microcontroller, and a fully functional PCB.

The Mini-Grid Game aimed to capture the key aspects of a power grid operation with considerations to Sustainable Development Goal 7 - access to clean and affordable energy. A simple LDR configuration was used to capture light intensity. This was mounted onto a servo motor which was controlled by an analogue joystick which formed part of the interactivity for the players. A score was generated at the end so players could compete against each other.

Ultimately the project scored 72%.
